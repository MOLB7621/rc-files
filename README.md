# rc-files

Startup files for vim and bash

These files will set up your terminals with prompts and commands that look
more like mine.

If you are on a Mac, you should install `coreutils` with homebrew:

```
$ brew install coreutils
```

Then copy the files over to your home directory:

```
$ cp .vimrc ~
$ cp .bashrc ~
$ cp .bash_profile ~
```

Logout, login and you should see e.g. a new prompt.

Open an issue if you have issues.
